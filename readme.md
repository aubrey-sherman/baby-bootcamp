## Baby Bootcamp

Baby Bootcamp is a companion tool to support parents who follow Suzy Giordano's "The Limited Crying Solution", a popular sleep-training program.

The app automates the tracking and calculations needed to gradually eliminate night feedings, making it easier for (likely sleep-deprived!) parents to implement this critical component of Giordano's sleep plan.

**Feature highlights and demo coming soon**

Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Express, Node.js, Luxon, and Drizzle ORM.
