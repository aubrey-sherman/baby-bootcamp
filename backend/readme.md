## Baby Bootcamp

Baby Bootcamp is a companion tool to support parents who follow Suzy Giordano's popular sleep-training method outlined in Twelve Hours' Sleep by Twelve Weeks Old: A Step-by-Step Plan for Baby Sleep Success.

The app automates the tracking and calculations needed to gradually eliminate night feedings, making it easier for (likely sleep-deprived!) parents to implement this critical component of Giordano's sleep plan.

The backend application is a JSON-returning API.

Back-End Tech Stack: Express.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
